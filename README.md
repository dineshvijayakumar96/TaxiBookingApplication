# 🚖 Taxi Booking Application

Welcome to the **Taxi Booking Application**, a console-based system that efficiently manages taxi bookings, optimizes taxi allocation, and ensures fair distribution of earnings among taxis. This project demonstrates my expertise in **Java, Data Structures, and Algorithm Optimization** while applying **OOP principles** and **real-world problem-solving skills**.

## 🔥 Features

✅ **Taxi Allocation Algorithm** - Assigns taxis based on availability, nearest location, and lowest earnings.  
✅ **Precomputed Distance Matrix** - Optimizes distance calculations for efficiency.  
✅ **TreeMap for Fast Lookups** - Ensures quick taxi retrieval and sorting.  
✅ **Trip Management** - Stores trip history with booking details.  
✅ **Fair Earnings Distribution** - Prioritizes taxis with lower earnings to ensure fairness.  
✅ **User-Friendly Menu** - Simple input-based interaction for taxi booking and details retrieval.

## 📜 How It Works

1️⃣ **User inputs pickup & drop-off locations**.  
2️⃣ **System checks for available taxis** and assigns based on optimized criteria.  
3️⃣ **Trip details are stored**, and taxi earnings are updated.  
4️⃣ **Users can check taxi details and history** anytime.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Java ☕
- **Data Structures**: TreeMap, HashMap, ArrayList
- **Algorithms**: Greedy approach for taxi selection
- **OOP Principles**: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism
